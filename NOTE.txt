Final Note

I want to take a moment to thank RagaAI for giving me the opportunity to work on this project and submit my prototype. 
t’s been a great learning experience building this agent from scratch, and I truly appreciate the challenge—it pushed me to explore a wide range of tools, technologies, and ways of thinking.
Although the complete Streamlit app is not fully functional yet, I’ve made strong progress on all the core components individually.
Each agent has been developed and tested with sample data or real-time inputs, and they work well on their own.

Voice Agent: I’ve set up a system that accurately converts voice input into text and responds with speech. 
It has been tested with clear prompts and gives natural-sounding responses.

Retriever Agent: This component fetches the latest news related to stock tickers and uses vector embeddings with semantic similarity search to pull out the most relevant content. 
I tested it with common tickers like AAPL and TSLA, and it returns meaningful results.

Analysis Agent: It takes the retrieved content and does a basic level of sentiment analysis. 
While simple for now, it lays the groundwork for deeper financial insight.

Language Agent: Using a transformer-based model, it turns raw insights into a coherent summary of the market—like what you’d expect from a human-written brief.

All of these are connected through an orchestrator, and the architecture is modular and easy to extend. 
The final step—getting everything integrated in a smooth front-end using Streamlit—is in progress, and I plan to keep improving it even after this submission.

To sum it up, this prototype reflects the direction I want to grow in: building intelligent, real-world tools that communicate clearly and help users make informed decisions. 
I’m genuinely excited about RagaAI’s vision, and I’d love the chance to contribute to your work in a deeper way.

Thanks again for considering my application. Looking forward to what’s next.
